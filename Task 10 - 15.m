% Generate an N = 50 samples long Hann window and use your "DFTsum()" function to perform a DFT ongenerated window. 
% Plot the results, both in time and frequency domain. 
% What regions of the frequency plot correspond to low frequency components and what regions correspond to high frequency components?
